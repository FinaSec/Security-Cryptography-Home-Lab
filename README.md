Title
Security Cryptography Home Lab

## Overview
This repository documents hands-on cryptography experiments focused on understanding
how encryption works in practice, how implementation choices affect security, and why
some cryptographic modes are considered unsafe in real-world systems.

The lab work emphasizes practical execution using OpenSSL, hex editors, and controlled
experiments to demonstrate cryptographic weaknesses such as pattern leakage and weak keys.

## Focus Areas
- Block and stream cipher fundamentals
- AES encryption and decryption using OpenSSL
- ECB mode weaknesses and pattern leakage
- CBC mode behavior and randomness
- Key entropy and brute-force feasibility

## Lab Environment
- Host OS: macOS
- Tools: OpenSSL, Hex Fiend, Cryptool
- File types: Images, encrypted artifacts, hex-edited binaries

## Repository Structure
- `notes/` — Conceptual cryptography notes and foundations
- `labs/` — Hands-on cryptography experiments with documented steps and results

## Status
Initial cryptography labs in progress. Additional experiments and artifacts will be added
as the lab environment expands.
