Title
Security Cryptography Home Lab

Overview
This repository documents my cryptography focused home lab work, including concept notes, security analysis, and hands on experiments. The goal is to understand how cryptographic systems work in practice and how implementation choices can create or prevent real security failures.

Focus Areas
Block ciphers and security properties
Stream ciphers, nonces, and IV usage
Cipher modes and pattern leakage
Common implementation failures such as padding oracle conditions
Practical tooling using OpenSSL and VM based environments

Repository Layout

Status
Foundation notes added. Hands on labs will be added as experiments are completed.
